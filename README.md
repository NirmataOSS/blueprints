# Application Blueprints

This repository contains Application Blueprints for Nirmata, a multi-cloud Microservices operations & management solution.

An Application Blueprint defines how an application is composed, and also contains policies that impact placement, orchestration, and run-time behaviours. See http://help.nirmata.com/en/latest for details.
